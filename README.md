# TTGO_T-Beam_Case

This collection of 3d models is for the TTGO T-Beam ESP32 development board. This board is programmable via the Arduino IDE, and has GPS, Wifi, Bluetooth and LoRaWAN radio capabilities. Example Arduino sketched can be found [here](https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T-Beam).


This model is a fork of Xkremator's SoftRF case. It's the same design, minux the cut out text. See their original model on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3041339)
